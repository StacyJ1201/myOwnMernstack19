// javascript is an interpreted language which means it does not have a compiler and executes line by line
// javascript has dynamic type casting which means it can change variables from a String to a boolean throughout the project
// hoisting is when variables or functions are moved to the top of the containing scope
// You can use a call or apply method to invoke a function immediately and sometimes pass an object
// keywords can contain special characters like $ or _
